# Team Darwin
Repo for Darwin Team. This is a project created for Senior Design at the University of Wyoming by Zakk Loveall, Austin Barner, and Vihan Garg. Our goal with this project was to simulate learning in generated environments. This project serves as a great base for a game or simulation.

The project works as a simulation where we used perlin noise with open simplex noise to randomly generate 2D terrains. We then added ants to random spots on this terrain, along with a piece of food at a random location. The ants would then utilize the popular Ant Colony Optimization algorithm with a dual pheromone system to locate and pathfind towards the food.

For a good reference of how this project works. Reference the better_slide.mp4 video.
